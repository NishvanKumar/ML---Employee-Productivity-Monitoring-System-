# ML---Employee-Productivity-Monitoring-System-
This project analyses employee productivity using machine learning. Linear Regression and Random Forest predict expected performance from targets and compute performance gaps. Isolation Forest and Z-score detect anomalies. The system ranks top and bottom performers and generates clear, shareable Excel reports for quick decision-making.
